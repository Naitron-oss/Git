# Git-Html5 Test App

## A Test Chrome Packaged App for the git-html5 library

## WARNING ALPHA CODE !!

this is very rough at the moment. open the js console - all the action is happening there.

to test:
* use the Choose Dir button to select a git working dir
* in js console run `testPackRead()`
* look through final result which should be showing the diff object for the top level tree of the HEAD commit
