# Git Crx

## A Chrome Packaged App for browsing local git repositories

## WARNING VERY ALPHA CODE !!

This is very rough at the moment!

Do **NOT** use this with any repositories you would cry about if they got deleted, corrupted or moved into an alternate universe.

## Install app for development or testing
* after git clone need to git init the git-html5 submodule 
* load into chrome as "unpacked extension" [sic]

## Debugging

* open the js console using Chrome dev tools - all the action is happening there.

## Usage

I've tried to key the key bindings similiar to [Tig](http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/manual.html) though much of the functionality of
TIg is missing here and some features of sj-tig have no equivalent in Tig.

j, down - move up through commit list
k, up - move down through commit list
HOME - Jump to first commit
END - Jump to last line
Enter - open currently selected commit
q. esc - close the current view

## Credits

This application is only possible thanks to the hard work of the authors of the excellant open-source libraries it uses.
