## A Chrome Packaged App for browsing local git repositories

## WARNING ALPHA CODE !!

this is very rough at the moment. 

## Install for testing
* after git clone need ot git init the git-html5 submodule 
* load into chrome as "unpacked extension" [sic]


## Debugging
* open the js console using Chrome dev tools - all the action is happening there.
